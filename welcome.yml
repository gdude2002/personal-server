    # Welcome!

    This is <@109040264529608704>'s personal server, a space for friends, professional contacts, and curious folks to hang out.
    If you know <@109040264529608704>, then you'll likely already understand that this is a progressive space - 
    so please remember that when interacting here!
    

    This server has a set of roles you can use to hide particular types of content.
    For more information, see <id:customize>.

  text: "# Our Rules"
  rules:
    "Follow Discord's Rules": >-
      We're required to enforce Discord's rules - that means that everyone must follow the 
      [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/terms/guidelines).

    "Try to Speak English": >-
      While we understand that not everyone speaks native-level English, it is the primary
      language used here, and we can't moderate messages written in other languauges.
      

      Please try your best, and feel free to use translation tools if you need to - we won't 
      tolerate anyone bullying others for their level of English.

    "Legal and Ethical Content Only": >-
      Everything shared here must be legal, legitimate and appropriate. Don't share anything that
      breaks Discord's rules or terms, or promote anything unethical (like generative AI tools or NFTs).
      

      This doesn't include things like queer self-expression, disability rights advocacy, or
      other progressive topics that tend to be banned by authoritarian governments.

    "Respect Other Users": >-
      Respect each other's differences and account for folks' accessibility needs:


      - No bigotry - including (but not limited to) racism, body shaming, ableism, sexism, classism, transphobia, pluralphobia, and queerphobia.
      
      - Keep topics appropriate - all public channels are "safe for work", meaning you shouldn't post overtly sexual content, gore, violence, or abuse content.

      - Keep interactions appropriate - No sexual advances, threats, blackmail, piracy, or any other problematic behaviour.

      - Respect [PluralKit](https://pluralkit.me/) users, and only use the bot for [plurality](https://moderation.wiki/a/plurality) or self-identity purposes, or as a mental health aid.

      - Don't post anything with fast-moving animations or flashing colours, or anything else likely to be an issue for photosensitive users.

    "Respect This Space": >-
      Respect this Discord server and do your part to keep things running smoothly:


      - Don't spam under any circumstances.

      - Check that you're in the right channel before posting, and read the channel descriptions.

      - Don't dump multiple memes into an off-topic channel - use them as part of a discussion.

      - Report any rule-breaking or otherwise problematic behaviour - don't wait for someone else to do it.

    "Productivity Over Yelling": >-
      Remember that everyone has their own life, with differing experiences. We are at our best when we think before
      we act, and we all appreciate someone doing their best to improve things for others.
      

      As this is a personal server, you will likely run into someone you don't like very much. You aren't expected to
      simply make amends, and your grievances are valid - but remember that everyone should be given a chance to improve
      if possible. Please do make use of block/ignore features, and submit any reports you'd like!
      

      In particular, remember that all users here are vetted, and thus most people you interact with here are not out to hurt 
      you. Additionally, if possible, please default to trying to educate when someone is misinformed or captured by
      disinformation, or simply reporting them if you'd prefer not to do that.
      

      **Note:** This is not a statement in support of respectability politics - you have a right to express your grievances
      as you prefer to. Instead, this is about curating your contacts, and trying to work on small improvements for everyone's
      benefit.
