    # Welcome!

    If you know <@109040264529608704>, then you'll likely already understand that this is a progressive space - 
    so please remember that when interacting here!

  text: "# Our Rules"
  rules:
    "Follow Discord's Rules": >-
      We're obliged to enforce Discord's rules - that means that everyone must follow the 
      [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/terms/guidelines).

    "Try to Speak English": >-
      While we understand that not everyone speaks native-level English, it is the primary
      language used here, and we can't moderate messages written in other languauges.

      Please try your best, and feel free to use translation tools if you need to - we won't 
      tolerate anyone bullying others for their level of English.

    "Legal and Ethical Content Only": >-
      Everything shared here must be legal, legitimate and appropriate. Don't share anything that
      breaks Discord's rules or terms, or promote anything unethical (like generative AI tools or NFTs).

      This doesn't include things like queer self-expression, disability rights advocacy, or
      other progressive topics that tend to be banned by authoritarian governments.

    "Respect Other Users": >-
      Respect each other's differences and account for folks' accessibility needs:

      - No bigotry - including (but not limited to) racism, body shaming, ableism, sexism, classism, transphobia, pluralphobia, and queerphobia.
      
      - Keep topics appropriate - all public channels are "safe for work", meaning you shouldn't post overtly sexual content, gore, violence, or abuse content.

      - Keep interactions appropriate - No sexual advances, threats, blackmail, piracy, or any other problematic behaviour.

      - Respect [PluralKit](https://pluralkit.me/) users, and only use the bot for [plurality](https://moderation.wiki/a/plurality) or self-identity purposes, or as a mental health aid.

      - Don't post anything with fast-moving animations or flashing colours, or anything else likely to be an issue for photosensitive users.

    "Respect This Space": >-
      Respect this Discord server and do your part to keep things running smoothly:

      - Don't spam under any circumstances.

      - Check that you're in the right channel before posting, and read the channel descriptions.

      - Don't dump multiple memes into an off-topic channel - use them as part of a discussion.
